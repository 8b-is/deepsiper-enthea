# @deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

MCP client bridge plugin: connects to external [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers and registers their tools on `ctx.tools`, making them available to the model as native tools under server-qualified names (`mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>`).

## Usage

One plugin instance per MCP server in `cordis.yml`:

```yaml
- id: mcp-github
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
  config:
    serverName: github
    transport: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-github']
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: !!js process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN

- id: mcp-web
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
  config:
    serverName: web
    transport: streamable-http
    url: http://localhost:3000/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: !!js '`Bearer ${process.env.MCP_TOKEN}`'
```

The model sees `mcp__github__create_issue`, `mcp__web__search`, … — the same server-qualified shape Claude Code and Codex use. HMR hot-swaps: editing the entry triggers disconnect + reconnect without process restart; an unchanged `serverName` reproduces identical tool names.

## Persistent HOST-local management

Mount `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client/settings` once in the Host composition beside `settings` and `tools`. It provides `ctx.mcpServers` and registers the live `mcp-servers` settings namespace, initially `{ servers: {} }`. Each dictionary key is the server namespace; entries default to `enabled: false` and use the transport fields below, without `serverName` or `failOnStartupError`. Saved connections default to a 10000 ms total handshake/discovery timeout. The settings provider owns persistence, so restarting the Host restores saved entries without editing presets.

Enabling a server launches its executable on the Host or connects to its HTTP endpoint; it does not run in the agent sandbox. Only save trusted commands and endpoints. DSH does not install or download servers. Stdio inherits the existing scrubbed environment plus explicit `env`; server stderr is suppressed because it may echo credentials. Every `env` and `headers` value is a write-only settings secret. Editors must use path mutation and revision fencing, not replace a configuration reconstructed from a redacted response.

Changes stop the affected connection before replacement and retain unrelated servers. Failures are isolated per server. An unconfirmed shutdown retains its namespace reservation and refuses replacement. `mcpServers.list()` reports actual connection state and registered-tool count with sanitized diagnostics. `mcpServers.test(name)` performs discovery only: active connections are reused, disabled entries get a temporary connection that closes before return, and neither tools nor persistent enablement change. The secured Web API exposes these as `api.mcp.list({})` and `api.mcp.test({ name })`.

The [Host MCP settings decision](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-11-01-host-mcp-settings.md) explains process ownership, discovery, and credential handling.

## Config

| Field | Transport | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `transport` | both | yes | `"stdio"` or `"streamable-http"` |
| `serverName` | both | yes | Namespace for this server's model-facing tool names; `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}`, unique across live instances |

## Tool naming

Every MCP tool has two names: the raw MCP name (sent on the wire in `tools/call`) and the public name `mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>` registered on `ctx.tools`. Public names are normalized to the DeepSeek function-name contract (64 chars, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`); when replacement or truncation changes the name, a deterministic 12-hex-char hash of `(serverName, rawName)` is appended so distinct tools never collapse into one name. Names are pure functions of `(serverName, rawName)` — connection order, re-syncs, and other servers never rename a tool.

- Two servers publishing the same raw name (e.g. `search`) coexist under their namespaces.
- A duplicate `serverName` across live instances fails the later plugin instance at load.
- A server listing the same tool name twice is rejected as an invalid tool list.
- A foreign registration squatting on this server's namespace rolls back the whole generation (never a partial set), with a loud error.

## Behavior

- On connect: plugin activation awaits `listTools()` and registers each tool via `ctx.tools.register()` under its public name before the composition starts its first turn. Initial connection, discovery, or registration failure is always logged; it rejects activation when `failOnStartupError` is true and otherwise activates with no tools.
- Listens for `notifications/tools/list_changed` → re-syncs; a fetch-phase failure keeps the previous generation registered, while a registration conflict rolls back the attempted generation and leaves no tools from that server.
- Tool execute: `client.callTool({ name: rawName, arguments }, { signal })` with timeout + abort support—the public name is never sent to the server.
- Canonical success is `{ content: JsonValue[], structuredContent? }`; complete JSON MCP blocks survive for programmatic callers. A supported advertised `outputSchema` validates `structuredContent`; unsupported schema vocabulary falls back to unconstrained `JsonValue`.
- Native/model rendering preserves MCP block order. Text-like runs join with newlines; resource links keep their name and URI as text; supported images become durable core image blocks only when `ctx.attachments` is mounted and the exact calling model route explicitly declares image input. The whole image batch is decoded and admitted before any member is saved. A malformed/refused image batch, audio, embedded resources, and unsupported blocks become explicit diagnostic text rather than disappearing.
- On disconnect/crash: the supervisor restarts the original server config with exponential backoff (`reconnect.initialDelayMs` doubling up to `reconnect.maxDelayMs`) and re-runs discovery on success — the recovered generation replaces the previous one, so tools neither duplicate nor leak. During the outage the last good generation stays registered; calls against it fail until recovery.
- Reconnection is budgeted per outage: after `reconnect.maxAttempts` consecutive failures the server's tools are unregistered and reconnection stops until an HMR reload or Host restart. A connection that survives past `maxDelayMs` resets the budget, so an occasionally-crashing server recovers indefinitely while a crash-looping one — even with briefly successful connects — still exhausts the cap instead of restarting forever.
- Reconnect states are user-visible in logs: reconnecting (warn, with attempt count and delay), recovered (info), final failure and disabled-loss (error). Disposal cancels any pending reconnect. With `reconnect.enabled: false`, a lost connection keeps tools registered but failing until a reload — the manual-recovery behavior.

## Model Experience

### Discovered MCP tools

#### What the model sees

After initial discovery succeeds, each advertised MCP tool appears as a native tool named `mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>` (or its deterministic normalized form), with the server-provided description and input schema. A successful re-sync — including the one after an automatic reconnect — replaces the generation; plugin disposal or an exhausted reconnect budget removes it. For an explicitly configured Smart Tree server, `off` omits the raw `memory` tool; `read-only` narrows its schema and independently rejects every operation except the literal `find` before dispatch. `read-write` retains the server schema. Changing this policy changes the registered schema prefix. Other tools remain unrestricted, recall may update access metadata, and no chat messages are saved automatically. This option does not provide a MEM16 adapter.

#### Token effect

Data-dependent schema cost is paid on every request while the tools are registered. Re-sync replaces rather than accumulates schemas, and the server-qualified name adds tokens to every tool definition and call.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the discovered tool set and schemas are unchanged. A re-sync that adds, removes, renames, or changes a tool replaces definitions and may invalidate reuse from the first changed schema token; a reconnect that recovers an unchanged list reproduces identical definitions and stays prefix-stable.

### Tool-call history and results

#### What the model sees

The public tool name and JSON arguments remain in assistant history. The execution-local canonical value always retains the complete JSON MCP blocks and optional structured content for programmatic and Code Mode callers. In Native context, supported image blocks are durably projected beside text in their original order after exact route-capability proof; Code Mode additionally ferries that settled rich projection through the outer `run_code` result without changing the canonical binding value. Refused images, audio, embedded resources, resource links, and unknown blocks remain visible as bounded text diagnostics, and MCP `isError` rejects the call before image persistence.

#### Token effect

Arguments, mapped text, and durable image references are retained until compaction. Inline MCP base64 stays only in the execution-local canonical value and is never copied into a session event; the provider reads verified bytes from the attachment store. Audio and embedded-resource payloads stay out of model context.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Tools are the only bridged MCP capability** — Resources and Prompts have no harness consumer and are deferred.
- **Discovery is not tool execution** — a successful check confirms handshake and advertised names, not whether the tools will work. Active connections that are reconnecting or failed must recover or be disabled before a fresh temporary check.
- **Reconnect triggers on transport close** — a crashed stdio child fires it; Streamable HTTP failures surface per request and through the SDK transport's own SSE-stream recovery, so an unreachable HTTP server is retried per call rather than respawned by the supervisor.
- **Image is the only durable rich-result bridge** — PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF can enter Native context after exact capability proof. Audio and embedded-resource payloads remain execution-local with explicit diagnostics, while resource links preserve only their name and URI as text.
- **Unsupported MCP output schemas are not enforced** — `structuredContent` falls back to `JsonValue` when the advertised schema uses vocabulary outside the harness subset.
